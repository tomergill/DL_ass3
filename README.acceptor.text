To run the acceptor, you should put experiment.py in the same place as the file generated by
gen_examples.py: pos_examples, neg_examples, pos_dev, neg_dev, pos_test and neg_test.

The acceptor will train on the positive & negative examples, check it's accuracy on pos/neg_dev and
finally predict on neg/pos_test, to a file defaultly named "test1.pred".

If you wish to temper with the net parameters, it can be done from inside the code: in the main
function, the relevent parameters are num_layers, embed_dim, in_dim, hid_dim, out_dim and epoches.
